DREAM HOUSE becomes MY-FINDER.

I will be honest. I thought that I will be able to do more with Zillow API. It turns out that a) I can't understand how to use it or b) it doesn't provide general search and there are issues with lots of data being restricted ...

My idea is to change this app into Yelp clone (with less functionality as I assume ... ) using their API (Yelp FUSION).
